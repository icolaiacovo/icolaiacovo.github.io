I am an Assistant Professor of Management at the University of Oregon (Lundquist College of Business) where my primary research interests are in entrepreneurship and labor markets. I completed my PhD at Harvard Business School where I created the Hiring at Top Startups (HATS) Study to explore the challenges faced by entrepreneurs seeking to grow their businesses. HATS 2024 has now completed data collection - stay tuned for the 2025 edition!
