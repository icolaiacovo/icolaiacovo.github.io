I am an Assistant Professor of Management at the University of Oregon (Lundquist College of Business) where my primary research interests are in entrepreneurship and labor markets. 

I completed my PhD at Harvard Business School where I created the Hiring at Top Startups (HATS) Study. The HATS Study is focused on exploring the challenges faced by entrepreneurs as they decide whether and when to grow their business, how to search for and assess potential employees, and how to choose compensation. 

HATS 2024 has now completed data collection - stay tuned for the 2025 edition!

My name is pronounced (Co-lay-<b>ah</b>-ko-vo).
