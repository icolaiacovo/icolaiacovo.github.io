I am currently a doctoral student in the Strategy Unit at Harvard Business School (my HBS page is [here](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1068346)). 

I will be on the academic job market in Fall 2023.

My primary research interests are in entrepreneurship across the spectrum of new firm creation, from small businesses to high-growth-potential startups. My job market paper is at the intersection of entrepreneurship and personnel economics: drawing on a novel survey experiment I conducted with approximately 550 high-growth-potential U.S. startups, I investigate how entrepreneurs search for employees and set compensation. 

I have taught undergraduates in the Harvard University Economics Department (sole instructor), and served as a teaching fellow for MBAs at Harvard Business School.
