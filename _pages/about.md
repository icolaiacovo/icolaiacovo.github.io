I am currently a doctoral student in the Strategy Unit at Harvard Business School (my HBS page is [here](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/profile.aspx?facId=1068346)). I am
the principal investigator of the Hiring at Top Startups (HATS) Study - now live and collecting data in its second year. My primary research interests are in entrepreneurship across the spectrum of new firm creation, from small businesses to high-growth-potential startups. I have taught undergraduates in the Harvard University Economics Department (as sole instructor), and served as a teaching fellow for MBAs at Harvard Business School.

In 2024, I will be joining the University of Oregon (Lundquist College of Business) as an Assistant Professor of Management.
