### “The Composition and Dynamics of Technology-Enabled Entrepreneurship” with Daniel P. Gross, and Jorge Guzman. *[Revise and Resubmit, Strategic Management Journal]* [SSRN Version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4383445) 

Using data on nearly all U.S. business registrations since the turn of the twentieth century, and a set of 386 major technologies invented over this period, we study the level, composition, and dynamics of entrepreneurial activity around new technology. We find a large, varied entrepreneurial economy rooted in innovation, where the vast majority of startups are not high-growth technology entrepreneurs but rather local, low-growth firms engaged in a wide range of complementary activities. The level and composition of this firm creation varies across technologies and over the technology lifecycle, and can be predicted from a technology's initial patents. We discuss implications of this evidence for research in entrepreneurial and technology strategy, business ecosystems, and industry dynamics.

### “The Transformation of Self Employment” with Margaret G. Dalton, Sari Pekkala Kerr, and William R. Kerr. NBER Working Paper w29725. [SSRN Version](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4028341)

Over the past half-century, while self-employment has consistently accounted for around one in
ten of the United States workforce, its composition has changed. Since 1970, industries with high
startup capital requirements have declined from 53% of self-employment to 23%. This same time
period also witnessed declines in "hometown" local entrepreneurship and the probability of the
self-employed being among top earners. Using 2016 data, we show that high startup capital
requirements are linked with lower profitability at small scales. The transition away from high
startup capital industries appears most closely linked to changes in small business production
functions and less due to advantageous reallocation to other opportunities, growth in returns-toscale
among large businesses, or a worsening of financing conditions and debt levels.

### “No Mask, No Service: Customer Reaction to Walmart’s 2020 National Mask Mandate” *[Revise and Resubmit, the Journal of Economics and Management Strategy]*

Multi-location firms face a complex series of economic tradeoffs when deciding whether to implement
standard processes or allow processes to vary across establishments. One element of this tradeoff is customer
response. This paper explores customer reaction to a prominent standardized policy, Walmart’s national instore
mask mandate during the COVID-19 pandemic. I find that, in the two weeks after Walmart’s corporate
mask mandate was enacted, foot traffic at stores in counties with no government mask mandates declined by
1-2% relative to stores in other counties. This effect was driven by stores in heavily Republican counties,
where the decline was approximately 5%. However, analysis of a spending panel suggests there was little
impact on sales conducted via credit and debit cards. This study provides evidence about the scope for
customer reaction in response to corporate policies which in turn informs decisions about the relative merits
of standardization or variance of policies across establishments.
