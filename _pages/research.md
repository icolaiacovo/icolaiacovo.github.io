“How do Entrepreneurs Set Wages?” [Job Market Paper - this draft is updated frequently]

What hiring strategies and resources do entrepreneurs use, and how do they think about setting compensation for their employees? 
Hiring beyond the founding team is essential to scaling a venture, but labor and search are extremely costly. To investigate hiring at growth-capable startups, 
I conduct a novel survey and experiment with 540 founders of U.S.-based startups that have, on average, 18 employees and \$6.8 million of funding. 
Entrepreneurs initially described hiring and compensation-setting at their own firms and then were asked for their best advice about wages for four fictitious job postings. 
This paper shows that these founders are much less likely than established firms to have human resources personnel and access to compensation consultants or paid wage benchmarking data, relying instead on word-of-mouth and free online services. Entrepreneurs' wage advice is highly dispersed and sensitive to information, particularly when the entrepreneur is a first-time founder or lacks experience with that position.
Finally, soliciting a "fair" wage rather than framing wages as a cost induced non-male entrepreneurs to recommend wages that were \$11,000 higher, on average. 
Taken together, these results suggest that startup hiring is undertaken by entrepreneurs under severe constraints and that compensation may be influenced both 
by available information and founder characteristics.
